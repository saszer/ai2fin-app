# Corrected Memory Fix - Use Existing Systems
# The monitoring systems exist but need proper configuration

Write-Host "ISSUE: Existing monitoring systems are misconfigured" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "SOLUTION: Fix configuration, don't rebuild systems" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "Step 1: Enable Garbage Collection (CRITICAL)" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "The code has global.gc() calls but --expose-gc is not enabled" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Command: fly secrets set NODE_OPTIONS="--expose-gc --max-old-space-size=400" -a ai2-core-api" -ForegroundColor Gray

Write-Host "Step 2: Lower Memory Thresholds (CRITICAL)" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Current: 90% threshold (too high for 256MB)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Fix: Lower to 75% for early warning" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Command: fly secrets set MEMORY_THRESHOLD=0.75 -a ai2-core-api" -ForegroundColor Gray

Write-Host "Step 3: Increase Memory Limit (CRITICAL)" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Current: 256MB (insufficient)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Fix: Increase to 512MB" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Command: fly scale memory 512 -a ai2-core-api" -ForegroundColor Gray

Write-Host "Step 4: Add Proactive GC (IMPORTANT)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "Current: Only reactive GC on high memory" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Fix: Add periodic GC every 30 seconds" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "Command: fly secrets set GC_INTERVAL_MS=30000 -a ai2-core-api" -ForegroundColor Gray

Write-Host "Step 5: Disable AI+ Services (MEMORY SAVER)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "AI+ services consume significant memory" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT WILL WORK AFTER FIX:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " HealthMonitor - will trigger at 75% instead of 90%" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " PerformanceMonitor - will alert at 70% instead of 85%" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " PerformanceOptimizer - GC will work with --expose-gc" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " ProcessManager - will monitor with proper thresholds" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "EXPECTED RESULTS:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " No OOM crashes (512MB + proper GC)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " Early memory warnings (75% threshold)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " Automatic garbage collection (--expose-gc)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " Memory savings (AI+ disabled)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host " Cost reduction (AI+ disabled)" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "COST IMPACT:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Memory increase: +.25/month" -ForegroundColor White
