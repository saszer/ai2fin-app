D. Future-Proofing & Scalability
If you add more upload endpoints (e.g., /api/bills/upload, /api/receipts/upload), just reuse uploadMiddleware.
If you need different configs (e.g., different file size limits), export a factory function from upload.ts that takes options.
E. Performance & Security
Never buffer large files in memory unless necessary. Use useTempFiles: true for very large files and stream them.
Validate file type and size in your route handler.
Log only on real errors; avoid noisy logs for non-upload requests.
F. Error Handling
Use your centralized error handler for all upload errors.
Return clear, actionable error messages to the frontend.
