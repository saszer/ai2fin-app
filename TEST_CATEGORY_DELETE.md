### **Test 2: Delete Category with Transactions**

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Categories
2. Find a category with transactions assigned (or create one and assign transactions)
3. Click the Delete icon
4. Verify modal dialog appears

**Expected Dialog Content:**
- ‚úÖ Red header with "Delete Category?" title
- ‚úÖ Warning alert: "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This action will permanently delete the category"
- ‚úÖ Message: "All assigned transactions will be marked as unassigned (no category)"
- ‚úÖ Category name displayed
- ‚úÖ Usage breakdown showing:
  - X transactions
  - X expenses
  - X bills
  - X bill patterns
- ‚úÖ Total count: "Total: X items will be unassigned"

- ‚úÖ Two buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete & Unassign All"

**Expected Result:**
- Dialog displays correctly with all information
- No console errors

---

### **Test 3: Cancel Deletion**

**Steps:**
1. Open delete dialog for category with transactions
2. Click "Cancel" button
3. Verify modal closes
4. Check category still exists

**Expected Result:**
- Dialog closes smoothly
- Category remains in list
- No database changes

---

### **Test 4: Confirm Deletion with Unassignment**

**Steps:**
1. Note the number of transactions assigned to the category
2. Open delete dialog
3. Click "Delete & Unassign All" button
4. Verify success message
5. Navigate to Transactions page
6. Check previously assigned transactions

**Expected Result:**
- Success message: "Category 'X' deleted successfully. All transactions marked as unassigned."
- Category removed from categories list
- Transactions now show "Uncategorized" or no category
- Transaction `categoryId` field is `null` in database
- No orphaned records

---

### **Test 5: Database Integrity Check**

**SQL Queries to Run:**

```sql
-- Check for orphaned transactions (should return 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BankTransaction 
WHERE categoryId NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Category)
AND categoryId IS NOT NULL;

-- Check unassigned transactions after deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BankTransaction 
WHERE categoryId IS NULL;

-- Verify category was deleted
SELECT * FROM Category WHERE id = 'DELETED_CATEGORY_ID';
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Check expenses were unassigned
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Expense 
WHERE categoryId IS NULL;
```

**Expected Result:**
- No orphaned records
- All previously assigned items now have `categoryId = null`
- Category completely removed from database

---

### **Test 6: Re-categorization After Deletion**

**Steps:**
1. Delete a category with transactions (unassign all)
2. Navigate to Transactions page
3. Select an unassigned transaction
4. Assign it to a new category
5. Verify assignment works

**Expected Result:**
- Can successfully re-categorize transactions
- New category assignment saved correctly
- Transaction shows new category

---

### **Test 7: Multiple Entity Types**

**Setup:**
Create a category used by:
- 5 transactions
- 3 expenses
- 2 bills
- 1 bill pattern

**Steps:**
1. Delete the category
2. Verify dialog shows all entity types
3. Confirm deletion
4. Check all entities are unassigned

**Expected Result:**
- Dialog shows counts for all 4 entity types
- Total shows 11 items
- All entities have `categoryId = null` after deletion

---

### **Test 8: Error Handling**

**Steps:**
1. Simulate network error during deletion
2. Verify error message displays
3. Check category still exists

**Expected Result:**
- Error message: "Failed to delete category: [error details]"
- Category remains in list
- No partial updates

---

### **Test 9: UI Responsiveness**

**Steps:**
1. Test on desktop (1920x1080)
2. Test on tablet (768px width)
3. Test on mobile (375px width)
4. Verify dialog displays correctly on all sizes

**Expected Result:**
- Dialog is responsive
- Content is readable on all screen sizes
- Buttons are accessible
- No layout issues

---

### **Test 10: Performance with Large Datasets**

**Setup:**
- Create category with 1,000+ transactions

**Steps:**
1. Delete the category
2. Measure time to complete
3. Check for any performance degradation
4. Verify all transactions unassigned

**Expected Result:**
- Deletion completes in < 5 seconds
- No timeout errors
- All 1,000+ transactions updated correctly
- No UI freezing

---

## üîç Console Checks

**During Deletion, Check Console for:**

1. Initial deletion attempt:
```
‚ùå Error deleting category: [error with usage details]
```

2. Usage check logging:
```
üîß Force deleting category "Office Supplies" with 30 usage references
‚ö†Ô∏è Unassigning all references - transactions will be marked as uncategorized
```

3. Success confirmation:
```
‚úÖ Unassigned 30 references from "Office Supplies" (set to null)
```

4. No error messages or warnings

---

## üìä API Testing

### **Test Delete Endpoint:**

```bash
# Try to delete category in use (should return 400 with usage details)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/categories/CATEGORY_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Force delete with unassignment
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/categories/CATEGORY_ID?force=true&unassign=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Force delete with reassignment (legacy)
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/categories/CATEGORY_ID?force=true&unassign=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Responses:**

1. **First attempt (no force):**
```json
{
  "error": "Category cannot be deleted",
  "message": "Category 'Office Supplies' is currently being used by 30 entities",
  "usage": {
    "transactionCount": 23,
    "expenseCount": 5,
    "billCount": 2,
    "billPatternCount": 0,
    "recurringPatternCount": 0,
    "categorizationPatternCount": 0,
    "cacheCount": 0,
    "taxCacheCount": 0,
    "totalUsage": 30
  },
  "canForceDelete": true,
  "suggestions": [...]
}
```

2. **Force delete with unassign:**
```json
{
  "message": "Category deleted successfully",
  "deletedCategory": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "Office Supplies",
    ...
  }
}
```
