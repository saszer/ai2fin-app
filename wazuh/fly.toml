  # Health check DISABLED for cost-optimized cold start deployment
  # Reason: Indexer takes 6+ minutes to start on shared CPU
  # Dashboard returns 302 redirect (not 200) which fails HTTP checks
  # Without health checks, traffic routes as soon as machine starts
  # Cold start time: ~6-8 minutes (user sees loading until ready)

# Note: Manager API (port 55000) is accessible via Fly.io internal networking
# Other apps in same organization can access: https://ai2-wazuh.internal:55000
