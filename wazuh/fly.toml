  # Health checks disabled because:
  # - Wazuh API requires authentication (returns 401/403 without auth)
  # - Fly.io HTTP health checks cannot authenticate
  # - Health check would always fail, preventing traffic routing
  # - Our init scripts (02-wait-for-wazuh-api.sh) already verify API readiness
  # - Fly.io will route traffic based on port availability
  # Note: If you need health checks, consider creating a simple health endpoint
  # on a different port that doesn't require authentication
