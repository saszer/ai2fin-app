  # Health checks for Wazuh API
  # Using HTTP check with long grace period:
  # - Wazuh API requires authentication (returns 401/403 without auth)
  # - Fly.io HTTP health checks cannot authenticate
  # - Health check will fail (401), but after grace period Fly.io may still route traffic
  # - Long grace period gives API time to start before checks begin
  # - Alternative: Script 02 already verifies API readiness
